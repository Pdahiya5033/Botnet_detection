# Botnet_detection
With increase in number of IoT devices coming to use, security threats are also increasing on alraming rate. So, I developed a botnet detection model by implementing various machine learning algorithms, and compared their performance based on accuracy, f1-score, recall and training time. 
Dataset used for this project is publicly available on internet. I tried to reduce feature set from 115 to 50 so as to reduce training time of algorithms without affecting performance of model.
